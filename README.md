# Event-Space
This application allows users to log in, create an event, attend events, view events they are attending, view events trending, view events they made.  If you own the event you can see who your attendees will be.  You can delete your events, edit your events,  log out, and delete your account.  If you delete your account, your events/attendances will be deleted with you.

Copy the long number into your browser's address bar and press enter.  You will be directed to the Event-Space Index page. Sign Up/Log in to create and attend events.
